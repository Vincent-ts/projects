                        My name is Vincent Stevens, and I am a student at Mission High School. I was born and raised in San Francisco. Growing up in the city has influenced my perspective of art from the beginning. 
When it comes to my digital artwork, I have a graphically focused minimalist artistic style. I like to focus on details, but I like things that stand out on their own, and are simple, yet complex. With my art, I like to focus on the simple things and let things speak for themselves, instead of doing too much. When creating artwork, I am inspired by things that I see walking around the city or out in nature. Most of my work is graphic design and photography, and I like to create geometric patterns shapes within my work. The themes of my work are contrast, minimalism, and geometry.
